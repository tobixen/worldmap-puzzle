"all.svg" is the autorative file.

territories are created with the splitout.py script.  To recreate, the files has to be deleted, and the script has to be run with "all.svg" as input parameter.  Ideally we should split by continent.

Continents are manually created from all.svg.  This should be automated.  Maybe create one layer for each continent?  I think Jaro said he needed one layer, in that case the name of each terrotiry may include the continent?
