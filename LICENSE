TODO: this file should be replaced with the actual license text, ideally the CC BY-SA 4.0 license text, but it's needed to do some legal research first - or eventually getting the permissions needed.

The map files in this project is derivative work of a map file licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 - but that map is again based on a map originally made by Hasbro for their Risk game.  Hasbro certainly have copyright on their world map.  Probably this adaption is too different from the Risk game for Hasbro to have any legal rights over this product.


In addition some decorative elements (planes and boats) have been found at Wikimedia Commons and thrown into the baseplate file.  Those decorative elements are all either public domain or some version of CC BY-SA).
